Hey all! :wave:

I'm Nilesh Kevlani, a Software Engineer based out of India.

On most of the Internet, I go by `njkevlani` name.

For the majority of my career, I have been working on Distributed Backend Systems.

Right now I'm working with the Data Platform Team at [ShareChat](https://sharechat.com). This team is responsible for writing and maintaining common libraries and systems which are used across the company in different products, serving billions of requests per day.

Before ShareChat, I was working with [Rzorpay](https://razorpay.com) and [Crewkarma](https://crewkarma.com).

Check out my resume for more details.

Topics of my interests are programming in general, distributed systems, linux, desktop environments (xfce, i3, sway, niri), thinkpads, bash, editors (neovim, intellij), git, kubernetes, containers, protobuf, developer productivity tools, etc.

Expect to bump into these things while you go through my writings.
