# Tips for Making Debian Experience Better

Ensure installing `firmware-linux` for better hardware support. For example,
Bluetooth continuously connects and disconnects without this package.

Ensure installing `libpam-fprintd` for better fingerprint experience with
`fprintd`.

Ensure `desktop-base` is installed. It will give a better look to grub instead
of cyan screen.
